This is my Python class project. It is a basic 5d Modeler.

The idea is to offer the user a choice to model either a sphere or rectangulal prism then the user will choose the starting values, the change in time, and the change from the starting value over five iterations.

The app will process the output of the starting value plus four more iterations of the starting value plus the change (delta) to create five separate sets of space-time equations.

The requirements that will be met are:
	1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
	2. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
	3. Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
	4. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
	5. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.

The user only needs to have Python installed to run this (it is a python console app). The log that is created with all the data should appear in whatever folder the user runs the app from.
