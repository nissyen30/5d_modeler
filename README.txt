This is my Python class project. It is a basic 5d Modeler.

The idea is to offer the user the choice of 3 different customizable equations through a Python console app.

The user will choose the equation, the value of the coefficients, the starting value, the change in time, and the change from the starting value over five iterations.

The app will process the output of the starting value plus four more iterations of the starting value plus the change (delta) to create five separate sets of space-time equations.
